This is my personal list of things that could/should be done to improve PARI.

Note that the priorities are my own.  For the tasks taken from the PARI TODO
file, the priority there has been recorded in a parenthetical.

Priority classification (first column): [subjective and debatable]
3    as soon as possible
2    nice to have
1    probably not
0    no
-    unclassified


***********************  From the PARI standard TODO ************************

2  implement Jebelean-Krandick diviiexact

2  implement Mulders/Hanrot-Zimmermann Karatsuba short product t_REAL * t_REAL

3  add a 'variable' as an optional last argument in content, denominator,
   numerator, as is done in divrem (cf. 2.6.2)

**************************   Personal priorities  ***************************

2  Let sqrt work on INTMOD objects with a composite modulus.

2  Good code for finding recurrence relations.

2  Fast sieve for various internal purposes.  Perhaps the GPL'd version of
   Tom√°s Oliveira e Silva?

2  checkmult/checkadd should not factor but loop through multiples of prime
   powers (coprime to the power, of course).

2  Code a correct tetration-mod-m function.

2  Extend fnice() to printing factored polynomials.  Perhaps also accepting
   factorizations as input?

2  Script (function?) to deal 'nicely' with recurrence relations, finding Binet
   forms and searching for cycles (using cyclotomic junk above).
